# Referral Program

Invite friends to Slinq and earn 25% of their Season Pass points—forever.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your referral code">
    Visit the Referrals tab on the leaderboard page. Your unique 6-character code is generated automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share your link">
    Share `https://slinq.xyz?ref=YOURCODE` with friends.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Friends sign up">
    When they connect their wallet using your link, they're linked to you permanently.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Earn together">
    They get +10% bonus points. You get 25% of their earnings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reward Structure

| Participant | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| **Referee (new user)** | +10% bonus on ALL points |
| **Referrer (you)** | 25% of referee's total points |
| **Monthly cap** | 100,000 points per referrer |
| **Duration** | Permanent (no expiration) |

## Example

Your friend uses your referral code and:
- Trades 10 BNB = 10 trading points
- With 10% bonus = 11 points for them
- You earn = 11 × 25% = 2.75 points

If they create a successful token:
- Earns 1,000 creator points
- With 10% bonus = 1,100 points for them
- You earn = 1,100 × 25% = 275 points

<Info>
The more active your referrals, the more you earn. Building a network of active traders is highly valuable.

## Monthly Cap

To prevent gaming, there's a monthly cap:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Maximum referral points/month | 100,000 |
| Resets | First of each month (UTC) |
| Excess earnings | Do not count toward your total |

<Tip>
The cap is generous—you'd need referrals earning 400,000 total points monthly to hit it.
