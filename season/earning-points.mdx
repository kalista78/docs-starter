# How to Earn Points

There are three main ways to earn Season Pass points: trading, creating tokens, and referrals.

## Trading Points

Earn points every time you buy or sell tokens on Slinq.

| Activity | Points Earned |
|----------|--------------|
| Any trade | 1 point per BNB |
| Minimum | 0.5 points (~0.01 BNB trade) |

### How It Works

```
Trading Points = BNB Volume × 1 point/BNB
```

**Example:**
- Buy 0.5 BNB of $MOON = 0.5 points
- Sell 2 BNB of $DEGEN = 2 points
- Total: 2.5 points earned

<Info>
Both buys and sells count equally. Trade volume on any Slinq token earns points.
</Info>

## Creator Fee Points

When your tokens generate trading fees, you earn additional points.

| Activity | Points Earned |
|----------|--------------|
| Fee collection | 400 points per BNB |
| Minimum | 2 points per collection |

### How It Works

```
Creator Points = Fee Earnings (BNB) × 400 points/BNB
```

**Example:**
- Your token does 100 BNB volume
- 1% fee = 1 BNB in fees
- Your 40% share = 0.4 BNB
- Points earned = 0.4 × 400 = 160 points

<Tip>
Creating popular tokens is the fastest way to accumulate points. One active token can outperform months of trading.
</Tip>

## Referral Points

Earn a percentage of points from everyone you refer.

| Activity | Points Earned |
|----------|--------------|
| Referrer bonus | 25% of referee's total points |
| Monthly cap | 100,000 points per referrer |
| Duration | Ongoing (no expiration) |

### How It Works

When someone uses your referral code:
- They get a 10% bonus on all their points
- You get 25% of their total points earned

**Example:**
- You refer 5 friends
- They each earn 1,000 points
- Your referral bonus = 5 × 1,000 × 25% = 1,250 points
