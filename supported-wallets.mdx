## Network Setup

Slinq runs on **BNB Chain** (Chain ID: 56). Most wallets will prompt you to add or switch to BNB Chain automatically.

If you need to add BNB Chain manually:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Network Name | BNB Smart Chain |
| RPC URL | `https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org` |
| Chain ID | 56 |
| Currency Symbol | BNB |
| Block Explorer | `https://bscscan.com` |

## Getting BNB

You need BNB to pay for gas fees and trade tokens. Here's how to get some:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Buy on an exchange">
    Purchase BNB on Binance, Coinbase, or any major exchange.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Withdraw to your wallet">
    Send BNB to your wallet address using the **BEP-20 (BSC)** network.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start trading">
    Once BNB arrives, you're ready to create and trade tokens on Slinq.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Always use the **BEP-20** or **BSC** network when withdrawing. Sending BNB on the wrong network will result in lost funds.
</Warning>
