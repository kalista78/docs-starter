# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

<Accordion title="What is Slinq?">
  Slinq is a social token factory on BNB Chain. You can create tradeable tokens directly from Twitter, Farcaster, or our web interface. Every token automatically gets:
  - Locked liquidity on PancakeSwap
  - 40% of trading fees going to the creator
  - MEV protection during launch
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is Slinq different from pump.fun or Four.meme?">
  **Creator rewards:** Slinq gives creators 40% of all trading fees. Most competitors give 0%.

  **Multi-platform launch:** Create tokens from Twitter, Farcaster, or web—not just one interface.

  **BNB Chain:** Lower fees than Solana or Base, with deep PancakeSwap liquidity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Slinq safe?">
  Slinq is designed with safety in mind:
  - All liquidity is permanently locked (no rugs)
  - Smart contracts are open source
  - MEV protection prevents bot exploitation
  - No team tokens or hidden allocations

  However, memecoins are inherently risky. Only invest what you can afford to lose.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What blockchain does Slinq use?">
  Slinq runs on **BNB Chain** (Chain ID 56). All tokens are BEP-20 tokens traded on PancakeSwap V4 Infinity.
</Accordion>

## Token Creation

<Accordion title="How much does it cost to create a token?">
  Token creation is **free** (gasless). You only need to sign a message with your wallet—no transaction fees for deployment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I edit my token after launching?">
  No. Token parameters (name, symbol, supply, image) are permanent and immutable. Double-check everything before launching.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the token supply?">
  All Slinq tokens have a fixed supply of **100 billion** tokens. This cannot be changed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I set a custom supply?">
  No. The 100 billion supply is fixed for all tokens to ensure consistency across the platform.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's FDV and how do I choose it?">
  FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation) is the total market cap at launch. It determines your token's initial price.

  - **Low FDV (50-200 BNB):** Lower entry price, more growth potential
  - **Medium FDV (500-2,000 BNB):** Balanced approach
  - **High FDV (5,000+ BNB):** Higher initial value, needs strong community
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can someone copy my token?">
  Tickers are unique—no one can use the same symbol. However, anyone can create a similarly named token. Build your community to establish authenticity.
</Accordion>

## Trading

<Accordion title="Where are tokens traded?">
  All Slinq tokens trade on **PancakeSwap V4 Infinity** through our integrated interface. You can also trade directly on PancakeSwap using the token's contract address.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the trading fees?">
  - **Base fee:** 1% of trade value
  - **Creator share:** 40% (0.4% of trade)
  - **Protocol share:** 60% (0.6% of trade)
  - Plus gas fees for BNB Chain
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is MEV protection?">
  MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bots try to exploit new launches by front-running and sandwiching trades. Slinq charges higher fees (10% → 1%) during the first 2 minutes to make these attacks unprofitable.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why did my transaction fail?">
  Common reasons:
  - Insufficient BNB for gas
  - Price moved too much (slippage)
  - Network congestion

  Try again with more BNB in your wallet.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I trade on other DEXs?">
  Yes. Slinq tokens are standard BEP-20 tokens. You can trade them anywhere that supports the contract address. However, trading outside Slinq may have different fees.
</Accordion>

## Creator Rewards

<Accordion title="How do I earn as a creator?">
  You automatically earn 40% of all trading fees on your token. Fees accumulate in the fee locker contract and can be claimed anytime.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When can I claim my fees?">
  Anytime. There's no minimum or waiting period. Just visit your creator dashboard and click "Claim."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are fees paid in BNB or the token?">
  Fees are paid in **WBNB** (Wrapped BNB), which is equivalent to BNB. You can unwrap it on PancakeSwap if needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if no one trades my token?">
  No trades = no fees. Focus on building community and utility to drive trading activity.
</Accordion>

## Season Pass

<Accordion title="How do I earn points?">
  Three ways:
  - **Trading:** 1 point per BNB traded
  - **Creating:** 400 points per BNB in creator fees

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do points expire?">
  Points last until the season ends. When a new season starts, points reset to zero.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What do I get for points?">
  Points determine your rank on the leaderboard. Top performers receive rewards at season end. Higher tiers also unlock point multipliers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I transfer or sell points?">
  No. Points are non-transferable and tied to your wallet.
