# Twitter Token Launch

Create a tradeable token by tweeting at `@SlinqBot`. Your token deploys in seconds and is immediately tradeable.

## Tweet Format

```
@SlinqBot deploy $TICKER "Token Name"
```

**Examples:**
```
@SlinqBot deploy $MOON "Moon Token"
@SlinqBot create $DOGE "Super Doge"
@SlinqBot launch $PEPE "Pepe 2.0"
```

<Tip>
Keywords `deploy`, `create`, and `launch` all work the same way.
</Tip>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tweet your request">
    Post a public tweet mentioning `@SlinqBot` with your token ticker and name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bot processes your request">
    Slinq detects your mention and validates the parameters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token deploys">
    Your token is created on BNB Chain with locked liquidity on PancakeSwap.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive confirmation">
    `@SlinqBot` replies to your tweet with:
    - Token contract address
    - Link to trade on Slinq
    - Your creator dashboard link
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues

<Accordion title="My tweet wasn't detected">
  - Make sure your account is public, not protected
  - Check that you mentioned `@SlinqBot` correctly
  - Verify your ticker doesn't contain special characters
  - Wait 2-3 minutes—there can be brief delays during high volume
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ticker already taken">
  Each ticker can only be used once. Try a variation:
  - Add numbers: `$MOON2`, `$DOGE99`
  - Use abbreviations: `$MTK` instead of `$MYTOKEN`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rate limit reached">
  You can create 2 tokens per day via Twitter. Wait until midnight UTC for your limit to reset, or use the [web interface](/create/web) for additional launches.
</Accordion>

## After Launch

Once your token is live:

1. **Share the trading link** — Get it from the bot's reply
2. **Monitor trading** — Watch activity on your token's Slinq page
3. **Collect rewards** — Fees accumulate automatically in your creator dashboard
4. **Earn points** — Every trade earns you Season Pass points
