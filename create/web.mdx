## The 4-Step Launch Process

### Step 1: Token Details

Enter the basic information for your token:

| Field | Required | Details |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Name** | Yes | Your token's full name (1-50 characters) |
| **Symbol** | Yes | Trading ticker, e.g., MOON (1-10 characters) |
| **Description** | No | Explain what your token is about |
| **Image** | No | Upload a custom image or generate one with AI |

### Step 2: Social Links

Add optional links to build credibility:

| Link Type | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Website | `https://mytoken.com` |
| Twitter/X | `https://x.com/mytoken` |
| Telegram | `https://t.me/mytoken` |

<Info>

### Step 3: FDV Configuration

Set your starting Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV):

| Setting | Range | Default |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Starting FDV | 50 - 50,000 BNB | 500 BNB |

**What is FDV?**

FDV is the total market cap if all tokens were in circulation. It determines your token's starting price:

```
Token Price = FDV ÷ Total Supply
Token Price = 500 BNB ÷ 100,000,000,000 = 0.000000005 BNB
```

### Step 4: Review & Launch

1. **Review all details** — Check name, symbol, and settings

3. **Sign the transaction** — Your wallet will prompt for a signature
4. **Wait for deployment** — Takes about 10-30 seconds

## Common Questions

<Accordion title="Do I need BNB to launch?">
  No—token creation is gasless. You sign a message, not a transaction. You only need BNB if you want to buy your own token after launch.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I edit my token after launch?">
  Token parameters (name, symbol, supply) are immutable. However, you can update your profile and add more context to your creator page.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my image upload fails?">
  Images are stored on IPFS via Pinata. If upload fails:
  - Try a smaller file (under 5MB)
  - Use PNG or JPG format
  - Try the AI image generator as an alternative
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do I need to sign a message?">
  The signature proves you're the creator without paying gas fees. It's a cryptographic proof of ownership that links your wallet to the token.
</Accordion>
