# Farcaster Token Launch

Create tokens directly from Warpcast or any Farcaster client by casting at `@slinq`.

## Cast Format

```
@slinq deploy $TICKER "Token Name"
```

**Examples:**
```
@slinq deploy $BASED "Based Token"
@slinq create $FCAST "Farcaster Coin"
@slinq launch $DEGEN "Degen Mode"
```

<Tip>
Keywords `deploy`, `create`, `launch`, `make`, and `build` all work.
</Tip>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Cast your token">
    Post a cast mentioning `@slinq` with your ticker and name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Slinq processes the cast">
    The Farcaster bot validates your request and prepares the deployment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token goes live">
    Your token deploys on BNB Chain with locked liquidity.

  <Step title="Confirmation cast">
    Slinq replies to your cast with:

## Common Issues

<Accordion title="Cast not detected">
  - Ensure you're mentioning `@slinq` (not `@Slinq` or other variations)
  - Check that your cast is public
  - Wait 1-2 minutes—processing can take a moment

<Accordion title="Ticker unavailable">
  Tickers are unique across the platform. Try:
  - Adding numbers: `$BASED2`
  - Using variations: `$BSED` instead of `$BASED`
