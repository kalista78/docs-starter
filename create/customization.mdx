# Customizing Your Token

The web interface lets you fully customize your token's appearance. Here's how to make the most of each option.

## Token Image

Your token image appears everywhere—in trading lists, on your token page, and in social shares.

### Image Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|--------------|
| Format | PNG or JPG |
| Maximum Size | 5 MB |
| Recommended Size | 400x400 pixels |
| Aspect Ratio | Square (1:1) |

### Image Tips

  <Card title="Keep it simple" icon="circle">
    Simple, bold designs work better at small sizes in token lists.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use high contrast" icon="sun">
    Your image should be visible on both light and dark backgrounds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid text" icon="font">
    Text becomes unreadable at thumbnail size. Use symbols instead.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Match your brand" icon="palette">
    Consistent colors and style build recognition.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Token Name

Your token's full name appears on trading pages and in search results.

**Good names are:**
- Memorable and unique
- Easy to spell and pronounce
- Related to your token's theme or community
- 1-50 characters

**Examples:**
- "Moon Token" for $MOON
- "Degen Mode" for $DEGEN
- "Based Protocol" for $BASED

## Token Symbol (Ticker)

The ticker is how traders refer to your token.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Length | 1-10 characters |
| Characters | Letters and numbers only |
| Case | Automatically uppercased |

**Tips:**
- Shorter is better (3-5 characters ideal)
- Avoid special characters
- Check that it's not already taken

<Warning>
Tickers are permanent and unique. Choose carefully—you can't change it later.
</Warning>

Your description tells traders what your token is about.

- **Purpose**: Why does this token exist?

Social links add credibility and help traders find your community.

Even if you don't have a website, add your Twitter. It's the easiest way for traders to verify you're real.

## Starting FDV

Fully Diluted Valuation sets your token's initial market cap and price.

### FDV Range

| Setting | Range |
|---------|-------|
| Minimum | 50 BNB |
| Maximum | 50,000 BNB |
| Default | 500 BNB |

### Choosing Your FDV

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Low FDV (50-200 BNB)" icon="seedling">
    **Best for:** New creators, community experiments

    **Pros:** Low entry, high growth potential

    **Cons:** Less initial liquidity
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium FDV (500-2,000 BNB)" icon="tree">
    **Best for:** Most tokens

    **Pros:** Balanced liquidity and growth

    **Cons:** Middle ground

    **Cons:** Needs strong community to sustain
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Price Calculation

```
Token Price = Starting FDV ÷ 100,000,000,000 (total supply)
```

| FDV | Token Price |
|-----|-------------|
| 50 BNB | 0.0000000005 BNB |
| 500 BNB | 0.000000005 BNB |
| 5,000 BNB | 0.00000005 BNB |
