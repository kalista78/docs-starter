# Security

Slinq is designed with security as a priority. Here's how we protect you.

## Smart Contract Security

### Locked Liquidity

Every Slinq token has **permanently locked liquidity**:

- LP tokens are sent to the LP Locker contract
- There is no withdraw function
- Not even the Slinq team can unlock liquidity
- This prevents "rug pulls" where creators steal funds

<Check>
Once liquidity is locked, it cannot be removed—ever. Your trading pool is permanent.
</Check>

### Immutable Token Parameters

After launch, token properties cannot be changed:

| Parameter | Changeable? |
|-----------|-------------|
| Name | No |
| Symbol | No |
| Supply | No |
| Image | No |
| Creator wallet | No |

<Info>
Immutability protects traders from bait-and-switch schemes where creators change token details after launch.
</Info>

### No Team Tokens

Slinq tokens have:
- 100% of supply in the liquidity pool
- 0% team allocation
- 0% pre-mine
- No hidden wallets

The creator only earns through trading fees, not token holdings.

## MEV Protection

### What is MEV?

MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks include:
- **Front-running:** Bots buying before your transaction to profit from price impact
- **Sandwiching:** Bots buying before and selling after your trade
- **Sniping:** Bots grabbing tokens in the first block of a launch

### How We Protect You

Slinq uses dynamic fees that decay over 2 minutes:

| Time After Launch | Fee |
|-------------------|-----|
| 0-30 seconds | 10% |
| 30-60 seconds | ~7% |
| 60-90 seconds | ~4% |
| 90-120 seconds | ~2% |
| After 2 minutes | 1% |

High early fees make MEV attacks unprofitable, giving regular users fair access.

## Fee Distribution Security

### Smart Contract Custody

Creator fees are held by the **Fee Locker** smart contract:

- Not controlled by Slinq team
- Only the creator wallet can claim
- Cannot be redirected or stolen
- Transparent on-chain

### Claim Safety

When you claim fees:
- Only your wallet can initiate the claim
- Funds go directly to your wallet
- No intermediaries or custodians

## Platform Security

### Wallet Connections

Slinq uses **Privy** for secure wallet connections:

- We never see or store your private keys
- Sign-in uses cryptographic signatures
- Session tokens are encrypted
- No password storage on our servers

### Signature-Based Deployment

Token creation uses EIP-712 typed signatures:

- You sign a message, not a transaction
- No gas fees for deployment
- Replay protection prevents duplicate deploys
- Signature proves ownership without exposing keys
