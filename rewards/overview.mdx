# Creator Rewards

When you create a token on Slinq, you earn 40% of all trading fees—forever. This is the highest creator share in the industry.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your token">
    Launch via Twitter, Farcaster, or the web interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trading begins">
    Users buy and sell your token on PancakeSwap.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fees accumulate">
    40% of the 1% trading fee goes to your creator wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim anytime">
    Withdraw your accumulated fees whenever you want.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Earnings Example

| Monthly Volume | Fee (1%) | Your Share (40%) |
|----------------|----------|------------------|
| 10 BNB | 0.1 BNB | 0.04 BNB |
| 100 BNB | 1 BNB | 0.4 BNB |
| 1,000 BNB | 10 BNB | 4 BNB |
| 10,000 BNB | 100 BNB | 40 BNB |

<Info>
Your earnings scale directly with trading activity. More volume = more rewards.
</Info>

## Why 40%?

Most token platforms give creators **nothing** from trading fees:

| Platform | Creator Share |
|----------|---------------|
| **Slinq** | **40%** |
| Four.meme | 0% |
| Pump.fun | 0% |
| Friend.tech | 5% |

Slinq believes creators should benefit from the communities they build.
