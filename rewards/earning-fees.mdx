# How Fees Accumulate

Every trade on your token generates fees. Here's how those fees flow to you.

## The Fee Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trade Happens">
    A user buys or sells your token on Slinq.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fee Collected">
    1% of the trade value is automatically collected by the LP locker contract.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Split Executed">
    The fee is split: 40% to your creator wallet, 60% to the protocol.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Balance Updates">
    Your pending balance in the fee locker increases.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim When Ready">
    You can claim your accumulated fees at any time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Fee Collection Mechanics

### What Generates Fees

Every trade in your token's pool generates fees:

| Action | Fee Generated | Your Share |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| User buys token | 1% of BNB spent | 0.4% |
| User sells token | 1% of BNB received | 0.4% |

### Fee Accumulation

Fees accumulate in the fee locker contract:

```
Your Balance = Sum of (0.4% × Trade Value) for all trades
```

<Info>
Fees are paid in WBNB (Wrapped BNB), which is equivalent to BNB and automatically unwrapped when you claim.
</Info>

## Tracking Your Earnings

### Creator Dashboard

Your dashboard shows:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pending Fees** | WBNB ready to claim |
| **Total Claimed** | Lifetime withdrawals |
| **24h Earnings** | Fees from the last day |
| **7d Earnings** | Fees from the last week |

### Per-Token Breakdown

For each token you've created:

- Trading volume (24h, 7d, all-time)
- Fees generated
- Your share earned
- Claim history
