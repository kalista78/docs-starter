# Claiming Your Rewards

When you're ready, withdraw your accumulated fees from the fee locker contract.

## How to Claim

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your wallet">
    Make sure you're connected with the same wallet that created your tokens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to your creator dashboard">
    Navigate to your profile or creator page on Slinq.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View pending fees">
    See your accumulated balance across all your tokens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Claim">
    Select the amount to withdraw and confirm the transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive WBNB">
    Funds arrive in your wallet after the transaction confirms.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Claim Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Claim All** | Withdraw your entire pending balance |
| **Claim Per Token** | Withdraw fees from a specific token only |

## Gas Costs

Claiming requires a small gas fee:

| Action | Typical Cost |
|--------|--------------|
| Single claim | ~0.001-0.002 BNB |
| Batch claim | ~0.002-0.004 BNB |

<Tip>
Wait until you've accumulated enough to make the gas fee worthwhile. There's no rush—your fees are safe in the contract.

## After Claiming

Once you claim:

1. **WBNB arrives** — Check your wallet balance
2. **Unwrap if needed** — Convert WBNB to BNB on PancakeSwap
3. **Use or hold** — Your BNB is yours to use however you want

## What is WBNB?

Fees are paid in WBNB (Wrapped BNB):

- WBNB is an ERC-20 version of BNB
- 1 WBNB = 1 BNB (always)
- Can be unwrapped to native BNB on PancakeSwap
- Works in all DeFi protocols

<Info>
Most DeFi activities accept WBNB directly, so you often don't need to unwrap it.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="No pending fees showing">
  - Verify you're connected with the correct wallet
  - Check that your tokens have trading activity
  - Fees update in real-time—if no trades, no fees
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Claim transaction failed">
  Common causes:
  - Insufficient BNB for gas
  - Network congestion

  **Fix**: Add more BNB and try again with default gas settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Claimed but didn't receive funds">
  1. Wait for the transaction to confirm (check BscScan)
  2. Add WBNB to your wallet if not visible
  3. WBNB contract: `0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can someone else claim my fees?">
  No. Only the wallet that created the token can claim its fees. This is enforced by the smart contract.
</Accordion>

## Tax Considerations

<Warning>
Fee earnings may be taxable income in your jurisdiction. Keep records of:
- Claim dates and amounts
- BNB value at time of claim
- Associated tokens

Consult a tax professional for guidance specific to your situation.
</Warning>

## Security Notes

- **Never share your private key** — No Slinq team member will ever ask for it
- **Verify the contract** — Claims only work through the official Slinq interface
- **Use hardware wallets** — For large balances, consider using a hardware wallet
