# Trading Fees Explained

Every trade on Slinq includes a dynamic fee that starts at 1% but adjusts based on market conditions. This fee is split between token creators and the platform.

## Fee Breakdown

| Recipient | Share | Per $100 Trade |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Token Creator** | 40% | $0.40 |
| **Slinq Protocol** | 60% | $0.60 |
| **Total Base Fee** | 1% | $1.00 |

<Info>
The 40% creator share is the highest in the industry. Most platforms give creators 0%.
</Info>

## Two Types of Fees

Slinq has two separate fee mechanisms that work together:

### 1. Hook Fees (Trading Fees)

The **1% base fee** (plus any dynamic premiums) is the **hook fee** - this is distributed between stakeholders:

| Recipient | Share | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Token Creator/Beneficiary** | 40% | Rewards the token creator |
| **Pool Initializer** | Variable | Rewards the launch executor |
| **Slinq Protocol** | Remainder | Platform sustainability |

<Info>
Hook fees are what you see deducted from your trades. These go to people, not burns.
</Info>

### 2. LP Fees (Liquidity Provider Fees)

Separately, PancakeSwap's native **LP fees** (0.3%) accrue to the locked liquidity position. Slinq uses these LP fees to create **deflationary pressure**:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Token Side → Burned" icon="fire" color="#FF6B6B">
    The token portion of LP fees is **permanently burned**, reducing the circulating supply of every token launched on Slinq. This makes all Slinq tokens naturally deflationary over time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="BNB Side → $SLINQ Buyback" icon="rotate" color="#4ECDC4">
    The BNB portion of LP fees is used to **buy back and burn $SLINQ** on a regular basis, creating sustained deflationary pressure on the protocol token.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Every trade on Slinq contributes to deflation through LP fees - both for the token being traded AND for $SLINQ itself.

## MEV Protection Fees

During the first 2 minutes after launch, a premium is added to **buy orders only** to protect against sniper bots. The premium decays using a **parabolic (x²) curve**:

| Time After Launch | Buy Fee | Sell Fee |
|-------------------|---------|----------|
| 0 seconds | 6% | 1% |
| 30 seconds | ~3.8% | 1% |
| 60 seconds | ~2.25% | 1% |
| 90 seconds | ~1.3% | 1% |
| 120 seconds+ | 1% | 1% |

### The Math Behind MEV Protection

The MEV premium follows a parabolic decay formula:

<Card title="MEV Premium Formula" icon="function">
```
mevPremium = 5% × (timeRemaining / 120)²

totalBuyFee = baseFee + mevPremium
           = 1% + 5% × (timeRemaining / 120)²
```

Where `timeRemaining` = 120 seconds - elapsed time since launch
</Card>

**Example calculations:**
- At launch (t=0): `1% + 5% × (120/120)² = 1% + 5% = 6%`
- At 60 seconds: `1% + 5% × (60/120)² = 1% + 1.25% = 2.25%`
- At 90 seconds: `1% + 5% × (30/120)² = 1% + 0.31% = 1.31%`

### Why MEV Protection?

MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bots try to:
- **Front-run** your transactions to buy before you
- **Sandwich** your trades to profit from price movement
- **Snipe** new launches in the first blocks

High early fees make these attacks unprofitable, giving regular users a fair chance.

<Tip>
If you're not in a rush, waiting 2 minutes after launch means you pay standard 1% fees.
</Tip>

## Volatility Fees

During periods of high price volatility, fees increase to protect liquidity providers. This uses a **Volatility Accumulator (VA)** that tracks price movements.

| Volatility Level | Fee Range | When It Triggers |
|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Normal** | 1% | Typical trading conditions |
| **Elevated** | 1-3% | Moderate price swings |
| **High** | 3-5% | Significant price movement |
| **Extreme** | 5-8% | Rapid pumps or dumps |

<Warning>
The maximum total fee is capped at **8%** regardless of how volatile the market becomes.
</Warning>

### The Math Behind Volatility Fees

Volatility fees use a **VA² (Volatility Accumulator Squared)** formula inspired by Meteora's DLMM:

<Card title="Volatility Fee Formula" icon="function">
```
volatilityPremium = (N × VA²) / 1,000,000

Where:
- VA = Volatility Accumulator (tracks tick deviations)
- N  = Fee Control Numerator (default: 40,000)

totalFee = max(mevFee, baseFee + volatilityPremium)
```

The VA accumulates based on how far the price moves from a reference point, then decays over time.
</Card>

**How the VA works:**
1. **Accumulation**: When price moves, VA increases by the tick deviation
2. **Decay**: If no trades occur, VA decays by 50% after 60 seconds
3. **Reset**: After 4 minutes of stability, VA resets to 0

**Example calculations:**
- VA = 500 (5% price move): `40,000 × 500² / 1,000,000 = 1% premium`
- VA = 1000 (10% move): `40,000 × 1000² / 1,000,000 = 4% premium`
- VA = 1500 (15% move): `40,000 × 1500² / 1,000,000 = 9%` → capped at 8%

<Info>
The VA² formula means small moves have minimal impact, but large rapid moves trigger significant protection for LPs.

## Comparing Fees

| Platform | Trading Fee | Creator Share |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Slinq** | 1% | 40% |
| Four.meme | 1% | 0% |
| Pump.fun | 1% | 0% |
| Uniswap | 0.3% | 0% |
| PancakeSwap | 0.25% | 0% |

<Check>
Slinq's 40% creator share means every trade supports the token's creator.
</Check>

## Gas Fees

In addition to trading fees, you pay network gas:

| Action | Typical Gas Cost |
|--------|-----------------|
| Buy | ~0.001-0.003 BNB |
| Sell (first time) | ~0.002-0.004 BNB (includes approval) |
| Sell (after approval) | ~0.001-0.003 BNB |

<Info>
Gas fees go to BNB Chain validators, not Slinq. They vary based on network congestion.

## Fee FAQ

<Accordion title="Do I pay fees on both buys and sells?">
  Yes, the base 1% fee applies to every trade. However, the MEV premium (during the first 2 minutes) only applies to **buy orders** - sells always pay the standard fee.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are fees included in the quote?">
  Yes. The amount shown as "You Receive" is after all fees are deducted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I avoid MEV fees?">
  Wait 2 minutes after launch to pay standard 1% fees. The MEV decay is automatic. Or sell instead of buy - MEV fees only apply to buys.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the maximum fee I could ever pay?">
  The absolute maximum is **8%**, which only happens during extreme volatility (rapid pumps/dumps). Under normal conditions, you'll pay 1-2%.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I see my fee contributions?">
  Visit the token page to see:
  - Total fees collected
  - Your contribution to trading volume
  - Creator earnings from your trades
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="As a creator, how do I claim fees?">
  Visit your creator dashboard and click "Claim" to withdraw accumulated fees.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the token burn work?">
  This applies to **LP fees** (PancakeSwap's 0.3%), not hook fees. LP fees accumulate in both the token and BNB. The **token side is burned** directly, reducing supply. The **BNB side** funds regular $SLINQ buybacks and burns. Every trade makes tokens more scarce.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between hook fees and LP fees?">
  **Hook fees** (1%+) go to creators, pool initializers, and the protocol - these are the fees you see in your trade quotes. **LP fees** (0.3%) are PancakeSwap's native fees that accrue to liquidity - Slinq uses these for token burns and $SLINQ buybacks.
</Accordion>
