# Trading Fees Explained

Every trade on Slinq includes a 1% fee. This fee is split between token creators and the platform.

## Fee Breakdown

| Recipient | Share | Per $100 Trade |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Token Creator** | 40% | $0.40 |
| **Slinq Protocol** | 60% | $0.60 |
| **Total Fee** | 1% | $1.00 |

<Info>
The 40% creator share is the highest in the industry. Most platforms give creators 0%.

## MEV Protection Fees

During the first 2 minutes after launch, additional fees protect against bots:

| Time Window | Total Fee | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| 0-30 seconds | 10% | Maximum protection |
| 30-60 seconds | ~7% | High protection |
| 60-90 seconds | ~4% | Medium protection |
| 90-120 seconds | ~2% | Light protection |
| After 2 minutes | 1% | Standard fee |

### Why MEV Protection?

MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bots try to:
- **Front-run** your transactions to buy before you
- **Sandwich** your trades to profit from price movement
- **Snipe** new launches in the first blocks

High early fees make these attacks unprofitable, giving regular users a fair chance.

<Tip>
If you're not in a rush, waiting 2 minutes after launch means you pay standard 1% fees.
</Tip>

## Volatility Fees

During periods of high price volatility, fees may increase slightly to protect liquidity providers. This is automatic and temporary.

| Volatility Level | Fee Adjustment |
|------------------|----------------|
| Normal | Standard 1% |
| Elevated | 1-2% |
| High | 2-3% |

<Info>
Volatility fees are rare and typically only trigger during extreme price movements.
</Info>

## Comparing Fees

| Platform | Trading Fee | Creator Share |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Slinq** | 1% | 40% |
| Four.meme | 1% | 0% |
| Pump.fun | 1% | 0% |
| Uniswap | 0.3% | 0% |
| PancakeSwap | 0.25% | 0% |

<Check>
Slinq's 40% creator share means every trade supports the token's creator.

## Gas Fees

In addition to trading fees, you pay network gas:

| Action | Typical Gas Cost |
|--------|-----------------|
| Buy | ~0.001-0.003 BNB |
| Sell (first time) | ~0.002-0.004 BNB (includes approval) |
| Sell (after approval) | ~0.001-0.003 BNB |

<Info>
Gas fees go to BNB Chain validators, not Slinq. They vary based on network congestion.
