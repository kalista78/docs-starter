# How to Buy Tokens

Purchase any Slinq token using BNB. The process takes just a few clicks.

## Before You Buy

Make sure you have:

- [ ] Wallet connected to Slinq
- [ ] BNB in your wallet (for purchase + gas)
- [ ] Wallet on BNB Chain (Chain ID 56)

<Warning>
Only buy with funds you can afford to lose. Memecoins are highly volatile and speculative.
</Warning>

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your token">
    Navigate to the token you want to buy:
    - Search by name or ticker in the search bar
    - Browse trending tokens on the homepage
    - Click a direct link from Twitter or Farcaster
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the buy panel">
    On the token page, locate the trading panel. Make sure "Buy" is selected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your amount">
    Type how much BNB you want to spend. You'll see:
    - Estimated tokens received
    - Price per token
    - Total including fees
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the quote">
    Check the details:
    - Are you getting the expected amount?
    - Is the price acceptable?
    - Is slippage within your tolerance?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the transaction">
    Click "Buy" and approve the transaction in your wallet. Wait for confirmation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tokens arrive">
    Your tokens appear in your wallet immediately after the transaction confirms.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Quote

When you enter an amount, you'll see:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **You Pay** | BNB amount leaving your wallet |
| **You Receive** | Tokens you'll get |
| **Price** | Current token price in BNB |
| **Price Impact** | How much your trade moves the price |
| **Fee** | 1% trading fee included |

## Price Impact

Large trades move the price. This is called price impact or slippage.

| Trade Size | Typical Impact |
|------------|---------------|
| Small (< 0.1 BNB) | < 0.1% |
| Medium (0.1-1 BNB) | 0.1-1% |
| Large (> 1 BNB) | 1%+ |

<Tip>
For large purchases, consider splitting into multiple smaller trades to reduce price impact.
</Tip>

## MEV Protection

During the first 2 minutes after a token launches, dynamic fees protect against bots:

| Time After Launch | Fee |
|-------------------|-----|
| 0-30 seconds | 10% |
| 30-60 seconds | ~7% |
| 60-90 seconds | ~4% |
| 90-120 seconds | ~2% |
| After 2 minutes | 1% |

<Info>
Higher early fees discourage sniping bots and give regular users a fair chance.
</Info>

## Common Issues

<Accordion title="Transaction failed">
  Common causes:
  - **Insufficient BNB**: You need BNB for the purchase AND gas fees
  - **Slippage too low**: The price moved while you were confirming
  - **Network congestion**: Try again with higher gas

  **Fix**: Add more BNB to your wallet and retry.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Price changed">
  Token prices move constantly. If the price changed significantly:
  - The transaction may fail
  - You might receive slightly different amounts

  **Fix**: Refresh the page to get a new quote.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tokens not appearing">
  After buying, tokens should appear immediately. If not:
  1. Wait for the transaction to confirm (check BscScan)
  2. Add the token address to your wallet manually
  3. Refresh your wallet's token list
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I add the token to my wallet?">
  1. Copy the token's contract address from the Slinq token page
  2. In MetaMask, click "Import tokens"
  3. Paste the contract address
  4. The name and symbol should auto-fill
  5. Click "Add"
</Accordion>
