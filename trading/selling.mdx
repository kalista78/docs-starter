# How to Sell Tokens

Convert your Slinq tokens back to BNB at any time. Liquidity is always available.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your token">
    Find the token page:
    - Use the search bar
    - Go to "My Tokens" to see your holdings
    - Click from your transaction history
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the sell panel">
    On the token page, switch to the "Sell" tab in the trading panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the amount">
    Type how many tokens you want to sell:
    - Enter a specific number
    - Use percentage buttons (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the quote">
    Check:
    - BNB you'll receive
    - Current price
    - Price impact
    - Fees deducted
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve tokens (first time only)">
    If this is your first time selling this token, you'll need to approve the token contract. This is a one-time gas fee.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the sale">
    Click "Sell" and sign the transaction. BNB arrives after confirmation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Quote

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **You Sell** | Number of tokens leaving your wallet |
| **You Receive** | BNB amount after fees |
| **Price** | Current token price |
| **Price Impact** | How your sale affects the price |
| **Fee** | 1% trading fee deducted |

## Quick Sell Buttons

Use the percentage buttons for fast selling:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| 25% | Sell quarter of your holdings |
| 50% | Sell half |
| 75% | Sell three quarters |
| MAX | Sell everything |

<Tip>
Selling in portions lets you secure some profits while keeping exposure.
</Tip>

## Token Approval

The first time you sell any token, you need to approve it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Approval prompt appears">
    When you click "Sell" for the first time, your wallet shows an approval request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the approval">
    This allows Slinq to transfer tokens on your behalf. It costs a small gas fee.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Proceed with the sale">
    After approval, click "Sell" again to execute the actual trade.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
You only need to approve once per token. Future sells skip this step.
</Info>

## Price Impact on Sells

Selling moves the price down. Larger sells have bigger impact.

| Sell Size | Typical Impact |
|-----------|---------------|
| < 1% of supply | Minimal |
| 1-5% of supply | Noticeable |
| > 5% of supply | Significant |

**To minimize impact:**
- Split large sells into multiple transactions
- Sell during high volume periods
- Use limit orders on external DEXs if available

## Common Issues

<Accordion title="Approval stuck or failed">
  Token approvals can fail due to:
  - Low gas setting
  - Network congestion

  **Fix**: Wait a few minutes and try again with default gas settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insufficient token balance">
  Make sure you actually hold the tokens:
  - Check your wallet balance
  - Verify you're on the right network (BNB Chain)
  - Refresh the page
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transaction taking too long">
  BNB Chain is usually fast, but during congestion:
  - Wait up to 5 minutes
  - Check BscScan with your transaction hash
  - Don't submit duplicate transactions
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Received less BNB than expected">
  Price movements between quote and execution can cause differences:
  - Normal variance is < 1%
  - Large sells naturally have more slippage
  - The fee (1%) is always deducted
</Accordion>

## Tax Considerations

<Warning>
Selling tokens may be a taxable event in your jurisdiction. Keep records of:
- Purchase price and date
- Sale price and date
- Transaction fees paid

Consult a tax professional for guidance specific to your situation.
